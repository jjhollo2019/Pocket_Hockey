Instructions to Run with Emulator:
In order to run this application, your device must have Android Studio
installed. After unzipping the submitted folder, you can then open Android
Studio and import/open this project from the main menu. Within the IDE, ensure
that the emulator chosen at the top of your window is for a Pixel 2 running at
minimum Oreo (API level 26).  Or, to run the slate layouts we created use the 
Pixel C runnign at minimum Oreo (API level 26), this emulator is the best fit
to replicate the slate resolution size. Finally, press the play buttton at the 
top of your window (next to the emulator description) to launch the emulator 
and run the application. The app itself will automatically open, and your mouse 
will simulate any physical interactions with the phone screen. To play the actual
gmae with the emulator, it is recommended to use the extended emulator controls
to manipulate accelerometer values in game.
